# FourierDrawings

### A tool for drawing vectorial images using the Fourier series in Python.
### The idea was inspired by the video from [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k) about the Fourier series

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

Install all the required libraries via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Use
Run `python3 main.py`. To change drawing populate `img.txt` with a list of point. The use of https://shinao.github.io/PathToPoints/ is highly recommended. Other parameters can be chaged at the end of `main.py`
